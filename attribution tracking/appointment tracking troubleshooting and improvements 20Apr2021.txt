Today:

> research Guy email about appointment so can give answer on the ones so far in April  (spreadsheet for April is open; first few contacts open in AC in Chrome).

> Let's revisit the acuity tracking script to try to trigger on iframe loaded; see initial research page in Chrome

> Maybe add logic to check for elements in Acuity iframe before continuing the script?

> Gotta find a way to ensure that at least a default value is stored in Acuity 100% of the time.


conversion script in acuity

1. post request for querystring to window.top
2. wait for response
3. if response, then 
   a. get utms from querystring
   b. save values, even blank/null because that is what top window says it had
   c. save originating url from message into "form originating url" custom field
4. if no response/timeout, then
   a. store default values: source: acuity medium: website campaign: acuity_conversion_not-htmpage_not-unbouncepage
5. call zapier webhook to send values to AC

Acuity tracking script (HTM and Unbounce sites)

1. listen for messages
2. if 'htm_appointment_querystring'
   a. get current querystring
   b. post message to originator with querystring
